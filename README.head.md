# awesome-local-ai

> Curated list of AI tools that run **100% on your machine** — no cloud, no telemetry, no "local-ish" setups that secretly phone home.

Maintained by [Brethof AI](https://brethof.ai). Companion to
[awesome-llms-txt](https://github.com/BrethofAI/awesome-llms-txt) and
[awesome-private-ai](https://github.com/BrethofAI/awesome-private-ai).

## Why this list exists

The phrase "local-first" has been stretched to mean almost anything in
2026. Lots of tools advertise on-device AI but then call out to remote
APIs for "complex" prompts, sync your data to a "private" cloud bucket,
or ship telemetry that re-introduces every privacy problem the local
mode was meant to solve.

This list applies a strict rule: **the tool must perform inference on
hardware you own and not transmit prompts, embeddings, or audio off
that hardware during normal use.** Optional cloud features (like model
download or update checks) are fine; mandatory ones disqualify.

Where a tool is partially-local (e.g. ships a fully-local mode but
defaults to cloud), we say so explicitly. Every link is checked — a
CI-style sweep cuts entries whose URL 404s.

## Inclusion rules

To be listed:

- Inference happens on the user's CPU, GPU, NPU, or local accelerator.
- No mandatory account creation just to use the offline mode.
- Source code or signed binaries available — verifiable provenance.
- Maintained: a release, commit, or PR merge in the last 6 months.
- Real artefact (not a "coming soon" landing page).
